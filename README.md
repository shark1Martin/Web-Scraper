# Web-Scraper

Let's make some dough.

Applications Required:

- Pushover: To send notifications to your phone whenever the desired outcome appears.

- BeautifulSoup: To parse the web page and find the desired information to send to user.

- Selenium: To be able to open and operate on chrome. 

- Requests: To simplify the interaction with web services by abstracting complexities of manual HTTP connection management.


Things to work on:

- Make it so that it sends the entire bet entry (teams, odds, event, and bet amount)

- Potentially make a Windows Tray App, for experience?

- <Add AI-based alert filters> ??? Recommended by ChatGPT, maybe ill learn some AI, lets do it!
